<p> For my third visualization, I chose the theme of urban gardening within Brooklyn. I wanted to compare the neighborhoods containing the most densely concentrated areas of public gareining patches with their average income levels. My reasoning for merging these two data sets together is to confirm the general purpose of public gardening; serving the public. As this emerging trend of sourcing locally has been blowing up the past couple years, many public gardens have become overrun with growers and buyers with more money and self-interest (i.e. restaurants, food caterers) and has left less produce or open patches for lower income families. </P>


<p> What I particularly like about my map is that it is relatively easy to understand the few points i am trying to get across. Looking at the select Brooklyn neighborhoods with the highest concentration of public gardens, one can see they lie within a corridor or historically lower income neighborhoods (Bed-stuy, Crown Heights, and Brownsville/Canarsie in particular). This visual data is important when noting that these are areas that would otherwise be known as food deserts. So, although we do not have more in-depth data for produce sales/ wait lists of the people uilizing these public gardens, what we do know is a majority of these access points to fresh food is definitely made readily available to individuals and families alike from lower income communities.
