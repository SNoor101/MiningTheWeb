      <h3> Visualization Critique 2 - Jonah Bleckner</h3>
      <h3>Accidental Skyline</h3>
      <p>For my second visualization critique, I chose a CartoDB map that was produced by the Municipal Arts Society, entitled <a href= "http://www.mas.org/urbanplanning/accidental-skyline/"> "Accidental Skyline,"</a> in response to the proliferation of huge skyscrapers along the southern border of Central Park. This map has the potential to serve as a tool for the public to engage in the on-going and contentious debate about real estate development in the city.</p>
      <p>This map successfully allows users to make six different layers visible simultaneously. The first two layers illutrate the available Floor to Area Ratio (FAR) accross the five boroughs. Regions of the city with a high level of FAR availability (i.e. underused development rights) are considered extremely ripe for developers to build huge profitable building as-of-right. The map then allows users to see the spatial relationship between  the neighborhoods in NYC that are vulnerable to large scale developments, with the historic districts that are protected by the the Landmarks Preservation Committee. Other layers on this interactive map include: Parks, NYCHA's real estate portfolio, and the Subway Lines. One UX issue with this map is that you cannot easily compare the state of each borough; one is forced to look at each borough in isolation. However, the data visualization clearly communicates which areas of the city are likely to see massive redevelopments that are destructive to local communities.</p>

      <a href="http://media.bizj.us/view/img/4471501/sarah-marijuana-scenario-c1*750xx1199-679-0-98.jpg" target="blank"> Recreational Marijuana Zoning in Seattle</a>
      <p> The reason I chose this map was because of how huge of a factor the zoning was throughout the entire process of legalization. It was the key debate for opponents and supporters alike of this new industry that ws bound to thrive; where can and can't recreational shops be allowed to open?</p>
      <p>
      What I appreciate about this map is the careful detail to zoning, precisely showing the areas where new store are allowed to open. In addition, the points on the map which indicate both current medicinal dispensaries and others which plan on expanding into the recreational industry. However, it is the lack of other factors, other points and polugons, which represent schools, day cares, and other points or areas of interest where legal shops are forbidden from opening, which take away from this map's greatest potential. Thus, it is more two-dimensional and does not tell the complte story. If anything, I am left more confused by the zoning. </p>

      <h3> Visualization Critique 1 - Zak Accuardi </h3>
      <a href="http://www.dvrpc.org/webmaps/CyclePhilly/"> Cycle Philly </a> 
      <p> Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) is using a fun dataset gathered from the "Cycle Philly" app, which tracks users' cycling routes and prompts them to enter their trip purposes. This kind of data is valuable in transportation planning because it is hard to keep track of how many people actually use bike infrastructure, let alone why. Nonetheless this dataset is relatively incomplete just by virtue of the fact that it only represents the behaviors of 220 Philadelphia bike riders. To the mapmakers' credit, they acknowledge this clearly. </p>
      <p> The map's aesthetic is nice. The black background with bright colored lines seems like an industry standard at this point. It's a nice touch to distinguish between trip density along each corridor using both line width and color -- this map is trying to communicate one thing at a time and do it really clearly.  </p>
      <p> The interactive functionality is modest but informative, mostly allowing users to visualize frequent bike routes by specific trip purpose (by default, all trips are aggregated). It would be nice to be able to overlay different trip types to compare them more directly, or to add some additional contextual information, e.g. census demographics or even some of the major destinations that riders might be riding to and from. </p>

    <h3>Visualization Critique 1 - Jonathan Marable</h3>

      <a href="http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/04/11/the-park-service-maps-americas-natural-and-human-made-soundscapes-and-silences/"> The Park Service Maps America's Natural and Human-Made Soundscapes and Silences </a>

      <p> This article released on April 11, 2016 by the New York Times refers to a set of maps created by the National Park Service that showed amounts of ambient noise throughout the United States. The data was visualized quite well. The choropleth allowed for distinction between ranges of noise. The addition of the note distinguishing between the maps was definitely important to know in order to understand what the major takeaway should be from the maps. Though the map is missing titles, the legend helps the viewer understand what the map is showing.</p>

      <p> As stated on the National Park Service's site <a href=
      "http://www.nature.nps.gov/sound/soundmap.cfm"> Mapping Sound on a National Scale </a>, such maps are important because, 
      "http://www.nature.nps.gov/sound/soundmap.cfm"> Mapping Sound on a National Scale</a>, such maps are important because, 
      <blockquote>
      Park visitors and wildlife interact with each other and park resources through their senses, including the sense of hearing. So, protection of natural sounds is good for both ecosystems and the quality of visitor experience. Additionally, there are laws and policies that require the agency to conserve acoustic environments â€œunimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations."
      </blockquote>
      Mapping sound was a great way to bring awareness to the presence of sound in the environment. The story told by these maps are easy enough to understand whether the reader is a park official, a policymaker, or merely a resident of the United States.
      </p>
      <p> The visualization reveals compelling takeaways regarding ambient noise, land use, and the natural environment. I found the amount of naturally-occurring ambient noise to be particularly surprising. Though it informs us that noise levels tend to be higher in areas with greater moisture and vegetation, it also shows the mere presence of people tends to result in greater ambient noise. The level of ambient noise only increases as the concentration of people increases, and ambient noise levels are particularly high in cities. I would be curious to see a pair of maps comparing ambient noise levels during the day to ambient noise levels at night.</p>
      <p> The source data set can be found at the <a href="https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2217356"> NPS Data Store</a>. This location is also home to other data sets and maps pertaining to observations such as Nighttime Lights and Wind Power Potential. This source could be an important one to explore in terms of understanding and facing challenges we may face in the future regarding land management.</p>

      <h3>Visualization Critique 1 - Jonah Bleckner</h3>
      <h3>The Rich Live Longer Everywhere. For the Poor, Geography Matters</h3>
      <p>For this assignment, I wanted to select and reflect upon a data visualization that has reached a large audience, and so for that reason I chose a recent interactive map that was published by the New York Times entitled, <a href= "http://nyti.ms/23nEYyr"> "Rich Live Longer Everywhere. For the Poor, Geography Matters." </a> (On the subreddit, "DataisBeautiful," this trending NYT map has been viewed 4,784 times.)</p>
      <p>This visualization maps the life expectancy of 40-year olds with household incomes below $28,000, adjusted for race. In other words, the author of this map wanted to illustrate that beyond income, geography has a significant effect on public health. I think that this simple visualization powerfully drives this point home, especially since it is evident that life expectancy is on average higher for those individuals that live in some of the wealthier American cities along the east and west coast. From a technical standpoint, I did have some trouble figuring out what polygonal parameters were used by the author. They are vaguely identified as areas, and are too big to be census tracts or counties.</p> 
      <p>I also thought about how my perception about what message the map communicates transformed after reading the accompanying text. It contextualized the map within the current debates and scholarship that exists about the intersection between wealth and public health. In some ways, this map tells a nuanced story that challenges us to pose complex public policy questions.</p>

      <h3>Visualization Critique 1 - Matthew Caruso </h3>

      <iframe src="http://googletrends.github.io/iframe-scaffolder/#/s/01fJ5Q" width="100%" height="550" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

      <a href= "http://googletrends.github.io/iframe-scaffolder/#/view?urls=Thanksgiving%202015%7Chttps:%252F%252Fgoogledataorg.cartodb.com%252Fu%252Fgoogledata%252Fviz%252Fbf595f4c-7381-11e5-9ec5-42010a14800c%252Fembed_map&active=0&sharing=1&autoplay=0&loop=1&layout=narrative&theme=red&title=A%20day%20in%20the%20life:%20US%20Thanksgiving%20on%20Google%20Flights&description=The%20day%20before%20Thanksgiving%202015%20shown%20in%20US%20domestic%20and%20international%20air%20travel%20booked%20with%20Google%20Flights">Google Thanksgiving Flights</a>

      <p>One visualization that I found online was a map generated by Google to show the amount of people that were flying around the United States on Thanksgiving. The data is represented in a torque map and shows different airlanes color coded flying across the United States. I thought this was very interesting and effective why to display this data set because it shows were these flights are taking off and were they are landing.</p>
      <p> A map like this can show you how diverse the United States is and how someone can have family members living across the country. This map also shows flights leaving the United States and going overseas into different countries as well and this information is very useful because it shows you what types of airlines actually travel overseas. I was very impressed with how this data was represented in this map and I thought this map made it very easy to understand where certain airline companies fly and it was also very interesting to see where their final destination will be.</p>

      <h3>Visualization Critique 1 - Sami Noor</h3>
      <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/04/11/upshot/for-the-poor-geography-is-life-and-death.html" target="_blank"> The Rich Live Longer Everywhere. For the Poor, Geography Matters</a> 
      <p> This Monday, the NY Times published <q>The Rich Live Longer Everywhere. For the Poor, Geography Matters</q> and had a powerful visualization mapping out the life expectancy in relation with income. The data was supplied from the JAMA article <q>The Association Between Income and Life Expectancy in the United States, 2001-2014</q> which was published a day before According to the study design from the JAMA: Income data for the US population were obtained from 1.4 billion deidentified tax records between 1999 and 2014, mortality data were obtained from Social Security Administration death records.</p> 
      <p> Due to the fact that the visualization itself was interactive, you were able to see the data clearly as it mapped out life expectancies. However, it should be noted that the visualization clearly states <q>Life expectancy of 40-year-olds with household incomes below $28,000, adjusted for race</q>. Though it was seamless to look at the different life expectancies in various parts of the US on the map, it only reflected on a certain household income which could not be altered. Though, the data is then reorganized in a tabular format with more income levels (plus various correlations) and their corresponding life expectancies.</p>
