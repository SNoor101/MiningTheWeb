    For my visualization critique, I decided not to use a particular visual, but a site I have recently discovered. Data USA is a comprehensive interactive list of census & demographic data put into an extremely easy to use search based website. I enjoy using it because it effortessly compiles data into a straight forward, informative story rather than just listing it in the same fashion the census bureau does. What else is impressive is the list of sources. It's simple, meaning the page is easy to find, and each source is labeled in bold and briefly but clearly explained where it is used within the site. What else, there are also caveats listed for each data source. I particularly appriciate this because it lets the user know that not all parts of the data are going to be correct. My biggest criticisn of the US Census bureau are it's wild inaccuracies and the fact that one is just led to assume that all the data must be true. I tend to trust data more when it can be noted that there are some inaccuracies due to the author screening it before hand, rather than not knowing just how inaccurate it is overall.  The finishing touches are subtle but difference makers as well; the cloroplethed map, the interactive aspect of clicking on each state, county, PUMA or MSA and pulling up brief population and demographic info. These all may be very basic points that anyone could whip up on CartoDB, but to me they are still difference makers.
